Save time and hassle by automatically importing videos from your favorite sources on YouTube and Vimeo directly into your WordPress blog.

== Description ==

Easily define all the video sources you like to post on your WordPress blog and let Video Importer take care of the rest. In addition to importing past videos when you create a new source, Video Importer will check your sources for any new videos once per hour.

Adding a new source isn't just easy, it's also flexible enough to meet your needs. Choose between YouTube or Vimeo, choosing the type of feed, and then entering the username or ID. You can also set the post type, add categories and tags, choose the author and more for each source you're importing.

Works with:

**YouTube**

* User Uploads
* Playlists (limited support)

**Vimeo**

* User Uploads
* Groups
* Channels

We have created an easy to follow [tutorial on creating a YouTube API key](http://wie.ly/u/ytkey).

Videos are imported once per hour, but due to the way WordPress schedules events, the automatic import is only triggered when a page on your site gets loaded.

YouTube no longer publicly provides video tags.
